# Comprehensive Guide to File Reading in Python using `for` Loops

When you open a file in Python and use a for loop to iterate over its lines, Python internally handles the reading of the file and knows when it reaches the end of the file by detecting an EOF (End of File) marker. This is managed by the file object iterator protocol, which uses the __iter__() and __next__() methods.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

- File Object as an Iterator: When you open a file in Python, the file object itself is an iterator. This means it has __iter__() and __next__() methods defined, which are used to iterate over the lines in the file.

- Reading Lines in a Loop: When you use a for loop to read the file, Python calls the __next__() method of the file object to get the next line from the file.

- End of File (EOF) Detection: The __next__() method reads the next line and returns it. When it reaches the end of the file, it raises a StopIteration exception internally. The for loop handles this exception by stopping the iteration.

- Breaking the Loop: The for loop stops automatically when the StopIteration exception is raised, so you don't have to explicitly break the loop.

### Example
```python
# Open the file in read mode and print its content using a for loop
for line in open('my_file.py'):
    print(line)
```

### Explanation
Reading the File:

    The file is opened in read mode ('r').
    The for loop iterates over the file object f.

Internal Iteration Mechanism:

    For each iteration, __next__() method of f is called.
    The method reads the next line from the file.
    When it reaches the end of the file, __next__() raises a StopIteration exception.
    The for loop catches this exception and stops the iteration.
