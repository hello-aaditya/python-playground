# Understanding Closures in Python with `coffee_coder`

## The `coffee_coder` Function

The `coffee_coder` function demonstrates how closures work in Python. A closure allows a function to remember the environment in which it was created.

### Definition of the Outer Function

```python
def coffee_coder(num):
    def actual(x):
        return x ** num
    return actual
```

- **Outer Function (`coffee_coder`)**: Takes an argument `num` and defines an inner function `actual`.
- **Inner Function (`actual`)**: Takes an argument `x` and computes `x` raised to the power of `num`.
- **Return**: The `coffee_coder` function returns the `actual` function.

### Creating Function References

```python
f = coffee_coder(2)
g = coffee_coder(3)
```

- When `coffee_coder(2)` is called, it returns a function that squares its input (`x ** 2`), assigned to `f`.
- When `coffee_coder(3)` is called, it returns a function that cubes its input (`x ** 3`), assigned to `g`.

### Calling the Returned Functions

```python
print(f(3))  # Output: 9
print(g(3))  # Output: 27
```

- `f(3)` computes `3 ** 2`, which is `9`.
- `g(3)` computes `3 ** 3`, which is `27`.

## Complete Example with Output

```python
def coffee_coder(num):
    def actual(x):
        return x ** num
    return actual

f = coffee_coder(2)
g = coffee_coder(3)

print(f(3))  # Output: 9
print(g(3))  # Output: 27
```

### Explanation

1. **Closures**:
   - `f` is a closure that captures the value `2` for `num`.
   - `g` is a closure that captures the value `3` for `num`.

2. **Calling `f(3)` and `g(3)`**:
   - `f(3)` executes `3 ** 2`, resulting in `9`.
   - `g(3)` executes `3 ** 3`, resulting in `27`.

### Output

```
9
27
```

### Conclusion

- The `coffee_coder` function demonstrates how closures work in Python.
- The `f` and `g` functions are returned by `coffee_coder` with different captured values for `num`.
- When called with an argument, they perform the power operation using their captured `num` value.
